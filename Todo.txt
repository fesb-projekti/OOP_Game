To do:

figure out how to pass pointer to a function as function argument - done -> test it!
figure out how to assign pointer to a function to a variable - done -> test it!

Add KEY points to the map and define doors.
	-> maybe make map by drawing graphs of certain functions (e.g. sin(x) and y = x^2) with width of 3
	-> because functions in use are "continuous functions" we are guaranteed to have acces to the whole map (no isolated spaces, except those blocked by doors)
		-> DOORS would be points where theese functions intersect
	-> define KEY placement

Add ENEMIES
	-> movement with A* algorithm  - if player is in their radius 

Add ENEMY BATTLE DISPLAY to "partial class Display" -> solve for situations with multiple enemies 
	-> mybe pokemon like? 

Add names of weapons, potions, enemies, etc. to "Constants"
